      <br> This is my portfolio. The idea is to take interesting problems, proofs, and assignments that sort of summarizes each of my courses. 
      <br> Sometimes they are official assignments from the course, sometimes they are embelished proofs that we worked through during class, and sometimes they are 
      <br> just interesting problems that are just adjacent to the topic of the course that I worked on on my own. For my computer science courses they will likely all
      <br> just be links to my github where the various projects live. For the physics courses they are all just PDFs produced in latex and hosted here.
      <br>
      <br>      Note ** Nothing is posted yet, its still totally a work in progress! Hopefully I'll get it all up before May 2019

      <br> <b> Thermal Physics </b>        In my opinion, one of the coolest things we did in this course was derive a proof of the ideal gas law from first principles. However,
      <br>                                 because the focus of the course was not just to prove the ideal gas law, we proved concept after concept over weeks until all of a sudden
      <br>                                 we had a full proof. So I figured it would be cool to try to write out a full proof, from first principles, all in one place. This is that.
      <br> 
      <br> <b> Intermediate Mechanics </b> One of the culminations of this course was a full ballistic integrator (yes you read that right). I have included a link to my github
      <br>                                 where it lives. I am also working on an interesting mechanics problem based on the principles of the course to post here soon.
      <br>
      <br> <b> Physics Lab </b>            This is definitely my best report of the year. We used an interferometer to measure the thermal expansion of a copper rod. Its a fairly simple 
      <br>                                 concept but it was super cool to get to use an interferometer to do it! I included a PDF of the report and a link to github with the scripts I wrote 
      <br>                                 for data analysis.
      <br>
      <br> <b> Data Structures & Algs </b> Definitely the most interesting thing we did was to write an image compression algorithm. It uses quadtrees and all sorts of classic interesting data 
      <br>                                 structures. Check it out on my github.
