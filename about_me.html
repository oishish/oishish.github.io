      <br> I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in physics and computer science at the university of
      <br> british columbia. Before I came to school in vancouver, I went to high school in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Paltz_%28village%29,_New_York">upstate new york</a>. 
      <br> Some of my interests are nordic skiing, programming (see my <a href="https://github.com/oishish/">github</a>), and running (see my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/osheekey">strava</a>).
