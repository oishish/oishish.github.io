      <br> I am currently working as a research assistant for Dr Joshua Folk's lab at the Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter institute here at UBC. I am
      <br> primarily working with <a href="https://qmi.ubc.ca/about/directory/christian-olsen">Christian Olsen</a>, a PhD student in the group, on testing InAs nanowires for the development 
      <br> of fault tolerant quantum computing. Before I became a research assistant, I spent a semester as teaching assistant for an intro to cs course. 
      <br> I am fairly proffecient in scientific python, java, c++, and c. My primary interests in physics are quantum computing and computational physics.
