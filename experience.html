      <h3> Undergraduate Research </h3>
      Since January 2019, I have been working in Dr. Joshua Folk's Quantum Devices
      group housed the Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute here at UBC. The
      focus my research has been in the characterization of SiAs nanowires produced
      by the Manfra group at Microsoft Station Q. I have also been involved in a
      project designing and implementing a fully modularized wiring system free of
      hand wired parts for the group's dilution refridgerator. If interested,
      please email me!

      <h3> Coursework </h3>
      I have taken nearly all the standard physics coursework up to year 3 including
      a year of
      Electricity and Magnetism, Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Statistical Mechanics, Special
      Relativity, Mechanics, and Solid State Physics. I have also taken courses
      in algorithm design and analysis, software engineering, and systems.

      <h3> Undergraduate Teaching </h3>
      In the fall of 2018 I TAed a course called 'Models of Computation'. I was
      mostly a lab TA leading labs in which students used integrated circuits to
      design various types of very simple computing machines but I also held weekly
      office hours. Unfortunately, in the spring of 2019 I had to give it up to
      make room for my research position and have not been able to TA another
      course since. Hopefully I will get the chance to TA anotther course in the
      future.

      <h3> Misc/Languages </h3>
      I have experience in a few programming languages and am always interested
      in learning new ones! In order of my proffeciency - Python, C, Java, C++,
      and JavaScript. I tend to lean on C and Python for nearly all the development
      I do but I am comfortable in any of those 5 languages. I also have some experience
      with arduinos and other microcontrollers.
